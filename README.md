# FunNumbers

This is an Actions on Google project using a [Dialogflow](https://dialogflow.com) agent.

Trigger is "Talk to Fun Numbers".

It consists of two parts: A Number Game and A Basic Calculator.

The ApiAi_Agents folder contains the Api.Ai agent which you can restore you project to.

You can extend the [Project](https://github.com/IkechukwuAKalu/fun-numbers) to make something complex.
