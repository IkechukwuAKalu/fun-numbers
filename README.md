# FunNumbers

This project was done to contest in the [Actions on Google Challenge](https://developers.google.com/actions/) using an [Api.Ai](https://api.ai) agent. 

It consists of two parts: A Number Game and A Basic Calculator.

The Fun-Numbers.zip file contains the Api.Ai agent which you can restore you project to.

You can extend the [Project](https://gitlab.com/ikechukwu_a/fun-numbers) to make something complex.
